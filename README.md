# GECToR â€“ Grammatical Error Correction: Tag, Not Rewrite

This repository provides code for training and testing state-of-the-art models for grammatical error correction with the official PyTorch implementation

## Train model
To train the model, simply run:
```.bash
python train.py --train_set TRAIN_SET --dev_set DEV_SET \
                --model_dir MODEL_DIR
```
There are a lot of parameters to specify among them:
- `cold_steps_count` the number of epochs where we train only last linear layer
- `transformer_model {bert,distilbert,gpt2,roberta,transformerxl,xlnet,albert}` model encoder
- `tn_prob` probability of getting sentences with no errors; helps to balance precision/recall
- `pieces_per_token` maximum number of subwords per token; helps not to get CUDA out of memory

In our experiments we had 98/2 train/dev split.

## Model inference
To run your model on the input file use the following command:
```.bash
python predict.py --model_path MODEL_PATH [MODEL_PATH ...] \
                  --vocab_path VOCAB_PATH --input_file INPUT_FILE \
                  --output_file OUTPUT_FILE
```
Among parameters:
- `min_error_probability` - minimum error probability (as in the paper)
- `additional_confidence` - confidence bias (as in the paper)
- `special_tokens_fix` to reproduce some reported results of pretrained models

For evaluation use [M^2Scorer](https://github.com/nusnlp/m2scorer) and [ERRANT](https://github.com/chrisjbryant/errant).
